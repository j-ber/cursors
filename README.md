# Drift

**Prediction markets tell you what people will bet. The internet tells you what people are starting to believe. Drift flags the moment those two separate.**

Built at the Cursor Austin Grok 4.6 Hackathon, Aug 15, 2026. Path: Agentic Orchestration.

## The problem

Prediction markets run bets on "which Netflix show is #1" — and they resolve against Netflix's own official Top 10. But there's no quick way to see, in the moment, whether the market's odds and the online chatter about a show actually agree with each other, or whether one is calling something the other missed. Drift watches both and tells you the moment they stop agreeing.

## How it works

    REP --> UI["Dashboard<br/>markets · themes · account · explanations"]
```

Three watchers pull data on independent polling cadences. The Correlator (Grok 4.6) reasons over all three signals and scores how well they agree. The Reporter turns that score into a plain-English explanation. The dashboard shows tracked markets, cultural themes, a mocked account/trade book, and — front and center — **why** each signal changed or is being recommended.

Full architecture, data contracts, and cadences: see [`CONTEXT.md`](./CONTEXT.md) (source of truth) and the rest of the docs in [`documentation/`](./documentation/README.md).

## Quick start

```bash
git clone <repo-url>
cd drift
cp .env.example .env   # fill in API keys — see CONTEXT.md for which ones are required vs optional

# backend
cd backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
python orchestrator.py

# frontend
cd ../frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

Required for a minimal working run: nothing but Polymarket/Kalshi access (no key needed) and an xAI/Grok API key. Everything else has a free fallback — see `CONTEXT.md` → Environment Variables.

## Feature split (who owns what)

| Feature | Owner | Details |
|---|---|---|
| Data watchers (Polymarket/Kalshi, X API, Trends/News) | *(names)* | Each watcher polls its source on its own cadence — see `CONTEXT.md` |
| Correlator + Reporter | *(name)* | Grok-powered divergence scoring and explanation generation |
| UI / Dashboard | *(name)* | Tracked markets, themes, account & trades, explanation panel |

## Tech stack

Python backend (agents as independent pollers + orchestrator), Grok 4.6 API for reasoning, free/public Polymarket + Kalshi APIs, X API (or Google Trends fallback) for chatter, web frontend polling a shared JSON/SQLite store.

## Non-goals (v1)

No real trade execution (dashboard trades are logged, not placed on-chain), no live claim of "detecting manipulation" (this is a divergence signal, not an accusation), no coverage beyond Netflix/prediction markets. Full rationale in `CONTEXT.md`.

## Team

*(names, Luma emails)* — built solo/together in ~3.5 hours during the event.

## Disclaimer

This is a hackathon demo. It does not execute real trades, does not provide financial advice, and does not claim to detect real market manipulation — it surfaces a divergence signal between public data sources for research/entertainment purposes.
