# AGENTS.md — Cursor / Grok Working Context

Canonical for **architecture, the data contract, and ownership**. [CONTEXT.md](CONTEXT.md) is canonical for **product decisions, non-goals, and the decisions log**. [PLAN.md](PLAN.md) is canonical for **the build clock**. Nothing else claims authority — if a doc under `documentation/` conflicts with one of these three, these three win.

If you change the contract below, change it here first and tell the other three owners in the same breath.

## Product Vision

Water Cooler is an **AI prediction-market signal analyst**.

It watches prediction-market pricing and compares it with public evidence from social conversation, web/news signals, and an official/historical outcome source. Grok reasons across those inputs and surfaces moments where the market and the outside evidence diverge.

The product does **not** predict guaranteed profit and does **not** claim manipulation.

## Final Hackathon Scope

### One demo vertical

**Netflix Top 10 prediction markets**

### One primary question

> Is the market pricing the likely #1 U.S. Netflix show correctly relative to public evidence?

### Three data inputs

1. **Polymarket**
   - current probability
   - historical probability
   - volume
   - market metadata

2. **Grok X Search + Web Search**
   - relevant social chatter
   - topic velocity
   - relevant accounts / channels
   - recent web/news evidence
   - supporting and conflicting evidence

3. **Netflix Top 10**
   - current / historical ranking
   - prior-week movement
   - official or historical ground truth for replay

### One reasoning layer

**Grok Correlator**
- compares all inputs
- identifies aligned vs diverged
- returns a divergence score
- explains why
- returns a counterargument
- cites/returns evidence sources

## Required Product Screens

### Screen 1 — Signal Feed

Must show:
- market title
- current market probability
- divergence score
- YES / NO / WATCH signal
- one-sentence explanation
- `View Why`

### Screen 2 — Signal Investigation

Must show:
- current market probability
- probability history chart
- external signal scores
- Grok recommendation
- divergence score
- confidence
- prominent `Why?`
- source evidence
- bull case
- counterargument / risk
- `Replay Last Week`

### Lightweight Watcher Interaction

A simple `+ Watch Topic` modal is enough.

Do **not** build a full watchlist product during the hackathon.

## Killer Feature — Historical Replay

The replay demonstrates what Water Cooler would have seen at a prior point in time before the official outcome was known.

The replay must use real historical data where possible. Do not fabricate percentages or timestamps and present them as real.

The visual story:

```text
Earlier in week:
Market odds relatively low / flat
External evidence strengthening
        ↓
Water Cooler flags divergence
        ↓
Market reprices later
        ↓
Official outcome revealed
```

This is a demonstration of signal usefulness, not proof of guaranteed profitability.

                     DASHBOARD
```

## Grok Is Load-Bearing

Grok must visibly do meaningful work.

Grok should:
- search or reason over external evidence
- compare signals
- identify conflicts
- generate the divergence explanation
- generate the counterargument

Do not hardcode a rule such as `if social > market then BUY` and use Grok only to rewrite it.

## Shared Integration Contract

```json
{
  "market": {
    "id": "string",
    "title": "string",
    "odds_by_outcome": {"Outcome A": 0.41, "Outcome B": 0.22},
    "history": [{"t": "ISO8601", "odds_by_outcome": {}}],
    "volume_24h": 0,
    "timestamp": "ISO8601"
  },
  "evidence": {
    "scores_by_outcome": {"Outcome A": 71, "Outcome B": 88},
    "trend": "rising",
    "snippets": [],
    "sources": [],
    "source": "x_search|pytrends",
    "timestamp": "ISO8601"
  },
  "truth": {
    "week_of": "YYYY-MM-DD",
    "official_rank": [],
    "source": "netflix_tudum|google_trends"
  },
  "signal": {
    "verdict": "aligned|diverged",
    "divergence_score": 0,
    "explanation": "",
    "counterargument": "",
    "sources": [],
    "flagged": false
  }
}
```

Do not silently change this contract.

**Why `odds_by_outcome` and not `yes_price`/`no_price`:** most of the markets on the shortlist (`#1 Searched TV Show / Actor / Athlete on Google 2026`) are multi-outcome races, not binaries. A two-field price can't represent them. This shape handles binaries too — a binary is just two outcomes.

`counterargument` is not optional. Grok returns the strongest case that the gap is noise, in the same structured call. It costs nothing and it is the difference between an analyst and a hype machine.

A complete, hand-written instance of this contract lives at `shared/fixtures/demo.json` and exists **before** any integration works. Every track builds against that file so nobody is blocked on anybody.

## Judging North Star

The judge should leave remembering:

> The market and public evidence disagreed. Grok found the gap, explained it, showed the sources, and demonstrated the same idea through a historical replay.

One reliable end-to-end signal beats ten unfinished features.
