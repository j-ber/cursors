# Drift — Product Spec

## Problem

Prediction-market traders can see market odds, social chatter, news, and outcome data, but they must mentally connect those signals themselves.

Drift turns that fragmented research process into one explainable signal.

## User

A prediction-market participant who wants to understand whether the market price is aligned with public evidence.

## Job To Be Done

> When I am evaluating a prediction market, show me when market pricing and public evidence disagree, explain why, and let me inspect the sources before I act.
